### Next Steps for Future Agents

1. **Apply Database Migrations**
   ```bash
   npx prisma migrate dev --name add-chores-rewards-weather
   ```

2. **Start Implementing Features**
   - Use `feature_get_next` to get the highest priority feature
   - Use `feature_mark_in_progress` when starting work
   - Use `feature_mark_passing` when feature is verified

3. **Priority Order (based on feature IDs)**
   - Features 1-8: Security & Access Control
   - Features 9-23: Navigation Integrity
   - Features 24-35: Real Data Verification
   - Continue through all categories...

4. **Key Implementation Areas**
   - Parent/child role-based access control
   - Chores CRUD with claim/complete/verify workflow
   - Rewards CRUD with redemption workflow
   - Weather integration (Open-Meteo, Home Assistant)
   - Photo screensaver with Google Photos
   - UI overhaul with Skylight-inspired pastels

### Notes
- The project already has substantial existing code
- Google Calendar integration components exist but may need enhancement
- Focus on creating API endpoints for new features first
- Then build UI components for chores, rewards, weather, screensaver
- Test thoroughly before marking features as passing
